  {section %title=Tools
No specific tooling is needed to maintain buildscripts. Make files, and shell scripts are ASCII files and any text editor can be used to edit any file. Prefer editors with advanced programming features like syntax highlighting to edit efficiently those files.
  }
  {section %title=Dependencies
ABS handles software project build process and was originally designed fro GNU/Linux systems but has demonstrated capabilities for any Posix like system including windows with the help of posix compatibility tools such as Cygwin or MinGW.  Buidlscripts is currently validated with the following systems:
  - RedHawk Linux 7.2
  - Debian Linux 8.2
  - Debian Linux 9.3
  - SUSE Linux 12
  - Windows 7/Cygwin

About the use of GPL licensed products: ABS does not link itself with any product, it runs some GPL product through commands as a human user can do using an interactive shell. Then ABS can't be considered as a derivate product and GPL is not applicable to ABS itself.

This new feature is just started, and not yet ready for use. It is implemented as an additional module that is not yet built when packaging the distributable archives. The implementation will continue with next release and the new module will be inserted in build target when good enough for a preliminary use.

{section %title=Executable generation procedure
ABS is a tool providing a generic generation system for other software projects. It is a collection of make files and shell scripts and is not really built as itself. See ABS's documentation for information about how to setup a project to use ABS.
However, archive files shall be deployed on a repository. Here is the procedure to generate the packages:
  - clone ABS from the git repository (optional when you already have your own clone), and checkout the ABS release you need (replace {kw X.Y.Z} by the right ABS version).
{code %language=sh
{!git clone https://github.com/seeduvax/AcrobatomaticBuildSystem.git
cd AcorbatomaticBuildSystem
git checkout abs-X.Y.Z!}
}
  - build the packages
{code %language=sh
{!make dist!}
}
}
{section %title=Installation procedure
ABS is self downloaded by the projects using it. To let this happen, the archive files generated with the procedure detailed in the previous section, have to be put in the storage location behind the first URL you request your users to set in the {kw ABS_REPO} variable of the projects' configuration file. To do so, assuming you're still in the location of your ABS clone:
  - copy the generated packages to your repository, assuming {kw <reporoot>} is the root of the repository locally reachable from the host you are using for the build (alternatively, use your preferred file transfer mean when your repository is stored elsewhere).
{code %language=sh
{!mkdir -p <reporoot>/noarch
cp dist/*.tar.gz <reporoot>/noarch/!}
}
  - eventually, for your user projects convenience and let them identify only the partial {kw X.Y} version identifier, create symbolic links for each ABS package, for instance for the core package:
{code %language=sh
{!cd <reporoot>/noarch
ln -sf abs.core-X.Y.Z.tar.gz abs.core-X.Y.tar.gz!}
}
  - Then, tell your users the new version of ABS is available to let them update VABS (if needed) in their projects' configuration file and perform a refresh ({kw make cleanabs}).
